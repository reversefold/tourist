=======

Visualizes MongoDB data migration in a sharded cluster. JavaScript and HTML only, with [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), [require.js](http://requirejs.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.org/), [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/). No server-side component required.

You will need a hostname and port of one of your config database servers which has the `rest` and `jsonp` options turned on.

That's it! Clone, open index.html, enter your config server host and port, and watch as chunks get migrated.
